     - User:
       The User class models an individual user within the database, holding key information like username, password, and privacy status (isPublic). It maintains lists of friends, blocked users, and received messages, allowing each user to connect with others, manage interactions, and handle communication. Core methods in this class include adding/removing friends, blocking users, and sending or deleting messages, which enable interaction and relationship management. The equals method ensures that each user is uniquely identified by their username. This class interacts with TextMessage for messaging and is managed collectively by UserDatabase, which organizes users and handles system-wide operations.
